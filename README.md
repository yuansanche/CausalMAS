# CausalMAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Causal Discovery and Counterfactual Reasoning

*A collaborative, interpretable, and scalable framework for causal learning in multi-agent systems.*

## 🚀 Overview

**CausalMAS** is an open-source framework designed to integrate causal reasoning into multi-agent systems (MAS). It enables:

- **Collaborative causal discovery** through distributed agents with heterogeneous knowledge.
- **Counterfactual prediction** for "what-if" scenarios in dynamic environments.
- **Causal inference** under partial observability and confounders. 
  *Inspired by the causal roadmap methodology and MARL-causal fusion research.*

## 🌟 Key Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Multi-Agent Causal Graph Learning** | Agents jointly construct causal DAGs via constraint-based (e.g., PC algorithm) or score-based methods. |
| **Counterfactual Responsibility** | Quantify agent-level impact via counterfactual analysis (e.g., "If Agent A acted differently, would Outcome Y change?"). |
| **Causal Parameter Estimation** | Support for TMLE, g-formula, and propensity score weighting. |
| **Interpretable MAS** | Generate human-readable explanations for agent decisions using causal graphs and counterfactuals. |

## 📌 Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core CausalMAS (2025 Q2-Q3)

- **v0.1**: Baseline MARL integration with static causal discovery (PC algorithm).
- **v0.2**: Dynamic causal graph updates via agent communication.
- **v0.3**: Counterfactual simulation module for responsibility metrics.
  
  ### Phase 2: Advanced Inference (2025 Q4)
  
- **v1.0**: Causal effect estimation under unobserved confounders (sensitivity analysis).
- **v1.1**: Federated causal learning for privacy-preserving MAS.
  
  ### Phase 3: Real-World Applications (2026)
  
- **Healthcare**: Simulate treatment effects in patient-agent networks.
- **Autonomous Systems**: Responsibility-aware trajectory planning.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```python
from causalmas import Agent, Environment 
# Initialize agents with local causal models 
agent1 = Agent(causal_model="PC", data=df1) 
agent2 = Agent(causal_model="NOTEARS", data=df2) 
# Collaborative graph learning 
env = Environment(agents=[agent1, agent2]) 
merged_dag = env.learn_global_graph() 
# Counterfactual query 
cf_result = agent1.counterfactual("What if X=1?", intervention={"X": 1}) 
```
